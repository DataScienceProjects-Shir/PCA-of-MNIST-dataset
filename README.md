# PCA-of-MNIST-dataset

Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database (Total 784 * 784 dimensions)

firstly we performed the PCA manually by calculating the eigen values and eigen vectors to show the mathematical power of numpy and later we did the same by Scikit-Learn Library to show the usefulness of the library
The MNIST database of handwritten digits, available from this page, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image. 
The original black and white (bilevel) images from NIST were size normalized to fit in a 20x20 pixel box while preserving their aspect ratio. The resulting images contain grey levels as a result of the anti-aliasing technique used by the normalization algorithm. the images were centered in a 28x28 image by computing the center of mass of the pixels, and translating the image so as to position this point at the center of the 28x28 field.
